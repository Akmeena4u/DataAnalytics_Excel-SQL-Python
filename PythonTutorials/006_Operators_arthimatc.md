**Arithmetic Operators in Python**

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical computations on numerical values. They are essential for creating calculators and performing various calculations in your Python programs.

**Common Arithmetic Operators:**

| Operator | Name           | Example                                | Output |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------------------|---------|
| `+`      | Addition        | `15 + 7`                                 | 22     |
| `-`      | Subtraction     | `15 - 7`                                 | 8      |
| `*`      | Multiplication  | `5 * 7`                                 | 35     |
| `**`     | Exponentiation  | `5 ** 3`                                 | 125    |
| `/`      | Division (float) | `5 / 3`                                 | 1.6666... (approx.) |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `15 % 7`                                 | 1      |
| `//`     | Floor Division   | `15 // 7`                                | 2      |

**Code Example:**

```python
n = 15
m = 7

ans1 = n + m
print("Addition of", n, "and", m, "is", ans1)

ans2 = n - m
print("Subtraction of", n, "and", m, "is", ans2)

ans3 = n * m
print("Multiplication of", n, "and", m, "is", ans3)

ans4 = n / m
print("Division of", n, "and", m, "is", ans4)  # Floating-point result

ans5 = n % m
print("Modulus of", n, "and", m, "is", ans5)

ans6 = n // m
print("Floor Division of", n, "and", m, "is", ans6)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Variables:** `n` and `m` store integer values (15 and 7).
2. **Calculations:** Each arithmetic operation is performed on `n` and `m`, storing the results in variables `ans1` to `ans6`.
3. **Printing Results:** The code prints formatted messages explaining each operation and its corresponding answer.

**Key Points:**

* Division (`/`) results in a floating-point number (decimal value).
* Modulus (`%`) gives the remainder after division.
* Floor division (`//`) discards the fractional part and returns the integer quotient.

**Additional Notes:**

* Python supports operator precedence, which dictates the order of operations in expressions. Use parentheses to control the order if needed.
* Remember to use appropriate data types for your calculations. For example, if you need exact integer division, use floor division (`//`).

I hope these comprehensive notes are helpful!
