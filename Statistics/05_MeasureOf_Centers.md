# Descriptive Numerical Measures

In this , we will discuss descriptive numerical measures that describe the center of the data. There are four values that denote the center: Mean, Median, Mode, and Mid-range.

If you are already familiar with these concepts, you can skip this lecture. Otherwise, let's discuss them one by one.

## Mean

### Definition
The mean, also called the average, is obtained by adding all the values and then dividing by the number of values.

### Types of Mean
- **Population Mean (μ)**: When you collect data from the entire population.
- **Sample Mean (x̄)**: When you collect data from a sample of the population.

### Example
Here are the heights of five students:
- Heights: 160, 165, 170, 155, 174

To calculate the mean:
- Sum of heights: 160 + 165 + 170 + 155 + 174 = 824
- Number of students: 5
- Mean = 824 / 5 = 164.8

- If the class contains only five students, this is the population mean: μ = 164.8
- If the class contains 50 students and we use data from five students, this is the sample mean: x̄ = 164.8

## Median

### Definition
The median is the middle term when you order the data in increasing or decreasing order.

### How to Calculate
1. Order the data.
2. Find the middle term:
   - If the number of observations is odd, the median is the middle term.
   - If the number of observations is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.

### Example
Heights: 155, 160, 165, 170, 174

- Ordered heights: 155, 160, 165, 170, 174
- Median = 165 (middle value)

If there is an additional student with height 170:
- Ordered heights: 155, 160, 165, 170, 170, 174
- Median = (165 + 170) / 2 = 167.5

## Mode

### Definition
The mode is the value that occurs the maximum number of times in the data.

### Example
Heights: 160, 165, 170, 155, 174, 168, 168

- Mode = 168 (occurs twice)

If no value repeats, the data has no mode.

## Mid-range

### Definition
The mid-range is the average of the largest and smallest values in your data.

### Example
Heights: 155, 160, 165, 170, 174

- Largest value = 174
- Smallest value = 155
- Mid-range = (174 + 155) / 2 = 164.5

## Comparison of Measures of Center

- **Symmetric Data**: Mean, median, and mode will be identical.
- **Skewed Data**: Mean, median, and mode will differ.
  - Mean is influenced by outliers.
  - Median remains at the center.
  - Mode denotes the value with the highest frequency.

For data with outliers, the median is preferred over the mean unless outliers are removed.

## Mode for Qualitative Data

The mode can be calculated for qualitative data, unlike the mean and median. For example, if you have categories like North, East, West, and South, the mode will be the category with the highest number of occurrences.

### Example
- Categories: North, East, West, South
- Number of customers: North (50), East (30), West (20), South (10)
- Mode = North (highest number of customers)
