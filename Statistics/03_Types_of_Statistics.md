# Types of Statistics

In this, we will see the types of statistics. Statistical tools can be classified as descriptive or inferential.

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics describe the data. For example, a table summarizing data or a chart showing the distribution of people belonging to different countries.

### Example

Suppose we have collected data on students who are attending a course. Descriptive statistics on the age variable will tell us:
- The age of the youngest student
- The age of the oldest student
- How many students belong to each age group

This information helps in understanding the target audience and curating examples that are meaningful for most of the audience.

### Commonly Used Tools

Below is a list of commonly used tools for describing data. We will discuss them in detail in the coming lectures.

#### Measures of Center
- **Mean (Average)**: The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
- **Median**: The middle value when the data is sorted in ascending order.
- **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently in the data set.

#### Measures of Dispersion
- **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.
- **Standard Deviation**: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.

#### Frequency Distributions
- **Frequency Distributions for Qualitative Data**: Summarizes the number of times each category occurs.
- **Bar Charts**: Graphically displays the frequency distribution of categorical data.
- **Histograms**: Used to display the frequency distribution of quantitative data.

## Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics are used to make inferences from the data. We typically have a sample of observations and use these to make decisions or predictions about the entire population.

### Common Inferential Techniques

Below is a list of some inferential techniques. Since this training focuses on deep learning, we will cover neural networks in detail. We will also cover the basic descriptive statistical tools as they are essential.

1. **Hypothesis Testing**
2. **Confidence Intervals**
3. **Regression Analysis**
4. **Neural Networks** (Covered in detail in this training)

## Summary

Understanding both descriptive and inferential statistics is crucial for data analysis. Descriptive statistics help in summarizing and understanding the data, while inferential statistics help in making predictions and decisions based on the data.
