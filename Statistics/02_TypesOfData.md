# Basics of Statistics

## Introduction

In this lecture, we will cover the fundamental concepts of statistics, focusing on the different types of data. Understanding these types is crucial because various analyses are appropriate for different data types. 

## Types of Data

### 1. Qualitative (Categorical) Data
Qualitative data, also known as categorical data, is data that can be divided into categories. It is further classified into nominal and ordinal data.

#### Nominal Data
- **Definition**: Data that can be classified into distinct categories with no inherent order.
- **Examples**: 
  - Gender (e.g., male, female)
  - Country of origin
- **Characteristics**:
  - Categories are mutually exclusive.
  - No logical order or ranking.

#### Ordinal Data
- **Definition**: Categorical data with a clear ordering or ranking among the categories.
- **Examples**:
  - Customer satisfaction (e.g., not satisfied, satisfied, delighted)
  - Spiciness of food (e.g., less spicy, mild, hot)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Categories can be ranked.
  - Differences between ranks are not measurable.

### 2. Quantitative Data
Quantitative data is numerical and can be measured. It has an inherent order based on numerical values. It is classified into discrete and continuous data.

#### Discrete Data
- **Definition**: Numerical data that can only take specific values and cannot have intermediate values.
- **Examples**:
  - Number of heads when tossing a coin 10 times (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ... 10)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Countable.
  - Only certain values are possible (integers).

#### Continuous Data
- **Definition**: Numerical data that can take any value within a given range.
- **Examples**:
  - Heights of students (e.g., 170 cm, 170.5 cm, 175.6 cm)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Measurable.
  - Infinite possible values within a range.

## Summary

Understanding the different types of data is essential for choosing the appropriate statistical analysis methods. Remember the key terms and definitions as they will be used in future lectures.

## Notes

- Nominal data: Categories with no order.
- Ordinal data: Categories with a clear order but no measurable differences between ranks.
- Discrete data: Numerical, countable, no intermediate values.
- Continuous data: Numerical, measurable, infinite possible values within a range.
