# Summarizing Data with Frequency Distribution

In this video, we will learn how to summarize data by creating frequency distribution tables for qualitative and quantitative data. We will also see how to convert these tables into bar charts and how to construct histograms. This is part of descriptive statistics where we describe the distribution of our data.

## Frequency Distribution

### Definition

Frequency distribution is listing down categories from our data and writing the number of elements or data points that belong to each category.

### Example

Suppose 420 students get admission into a college. You have data where:
- Column 1 contains student names
- Column 2 contains the branch or specialization of each student

Such data is raw data. When you take out these branches as categories and find the number of students that belong to each branch, you get a frequency distribution table.

### Relative Frequency

Relative frequency represents the contribution of each category to the total. It is calculated as:

```
Relative Frequency = (Frequency of Category) / (Sum of All Frequencies)
```

For example, if 60 students are in Biotechnology:

```
Relative Frequency = 60 / 420 = 0.14 or 14.2%
```

### Bar Chart

A bar chart graphically represents the frequency distribution:
- Categories on the horizontal axis
- Frequency values denoted by the height of vertical bars

### Frequency Distribution for Quantitative Data

For quantitative data, we create buckets and assign the frequency of occurrence of values that belong to each bucket.

#### Example

Suppose we have a list of students and their science marks. To group this data:
1. Decide the number of buckets (usually between 5 and 20)
2. Determine class width using the formula:

```
Class Width = (Maximum Value - Minimum Value) / Number of Classes
```

3. Starting with the minimum value, keep adding the class width to get the buckets
4. Assign the number of observations belonging to each bucket

#### Manual Calculation Example

Given customer ages:
- Ages: 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34
- Number of buckets: 5
- Class width:

```
(34 - 7) / 5 = 5.4 (rounded to 5)
```

Buckets:
- 7 to 12
- 13 to 18
- 19 to 24
- 25 to 30
- 31 to 36

Tally marks for each age category are used to count frequencies.

### Histogram

A histogram represents the frequency distribution of quantitative data. It is similar to a bar chart but for quantitative data.

### Common Shapes of Histograms

- **Symmetry**: Distribution is the same on both sides of the center
- **Skewness**: Higher frequencies shifted towards one side
- **Uniformity**: Frequencies uniformly distributed across classes

## Normal Distribution

Normal distribution occurs frequently in recorded data and is assumed in many analyses. It is represented by:

```
f(x) = (1 / (σ * sqrt(2π))) * exp(-((x - μ)^2) / (2σ^2))
```

### Properties

- Total area under the curve is 1
- Curve is symmetric
- Tails extend indefinitely

In practical terms, the value at the mean has the maximum probability of occurrence, and as you go farther from the mean, the probability decreases.
