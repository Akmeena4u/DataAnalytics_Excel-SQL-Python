#### The Evolution of Resume Review and Evaluation

- **Adapting to New Realities:** Job seekers must understand the importance of keywords and formatting to pass through ATS and reach human reviewers.
- **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS):** These systems function as resume databases, helping companies streamline their hiring process, ensuring compliance with labor laws, and reviewing applications more efficiently.
- **Common ATS:** Examples include iCIMS, Bullhorn, and HCM. These systems digest uploaded resumes and allow recruiters to search submissions using keywords.

2. **Application Storage:** All submitted applications are stored in a database.
3. **Keyword Search:** Recruiters search submissions using keywords to identify candidates.
4. **Scoring Applications:** Many ATS score applications based on parameters of the open position, ranking candidates accordingly.

#### Importance of Keywords

#### Keyword Search Technique

1. **Master List:** Create a master list of keywords that appear in similar job postings.
2. **Mock Search:** Conduct a mock search to generate keywords, not to locate specific jobs.
3. **Company Websites:** Visit company and association websites to find relevant keywords.
4. **LinkedIn Profiles:** Analyze profiles of users with similar jobs to see their keywords.
5. **Member Directories:** Use association websites to find keywords used by industry professionals.

#### Location-Based Keywords

- **Importance:** Include location-based keywords if the job specifies a particular area.
- **Formatting:** Include your city, state, and zip code, and use a phone number with an area code.

#### Avoiding Keyword Omission

- **Explicit Duties:** Spell out all job responsibilities, even those that seem obvious.
- **Generalists:** Remember that initial resume reviewers may be generalists without specific industry knowledge.

---

#### Contextualizing Keywords

- **Professional Summary:** Use keywords in the professional summary or skills section at the top of the resume.
- **Throughout Resume:** Ensure keywords are used throughout the resume in the context of job responsibilities.
- **Example:** If a graphic designer used Adobe Photoshop, mention it both in the summary and the job description.

#### Tips for Using Keywords

- **Acronyms:** Include both acronyms and their spelled-out forms.
- **Professional Associations:** Mention relevant professional associations.
- **Cover Letters:** Embed keywords in cover letters as they might be scanned by ATS.
- **Social Media Profiles:** Use keywords in LinkedIn and other social media profiles.

#### Formatting for ATS

- **Simple Formatting:** Avoid templates, images, columns, tables, text boxes, and graphics.
- **Common Headings:** Use common headings like summary, work experience, education, skills, etc.
- **Fonts and Colors:** Use standard fonts (Arial, Georgia, Tahoma) and only black color.
- **Avoid Underlining:** Underlining can disrupt the legibility of certain letters.
- **Contact Information:** Place contact information in the body of the resume, not in the header or footer.
- **File Format:** Save the resume as a basic Word document or plain text.
- **Consistency:** Present information for each employer in the same order: company name, title, city, state, and date in reverse chronological order.
- **Avoid Typos:** Ensure there are no spelling errors as ATS cannot interpret typos.
