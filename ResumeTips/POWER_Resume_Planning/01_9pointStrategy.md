### Writing an Effective Résumé

---

**Introduction**

To write an effective résumé, you need to learn how to write powerful advertisement copy. You must sell a product in which you have a large personal investment: yourself.

Most people do not think in a marketing-oriented way and may not look forward to selling themselves. However, to increase your job hunting effectiveness, it is wise to learn how to create a spectacular résumé.

You do not need to hard sell or make any untrue claims. You just need to overcome your modesty and reluctance to promote yourself. Often, the best-advertised product, not necessarily the best product, gets sold. This is good news for those willing to put in the effort to create an excellent résumé. 

With a little extra effort, you can often get a better response from prospective employers than those with superior credentials.

**Nine-Point Strategy for Writing a Résumé**

1. **Focus on the Employer's Needs, Not Yours**
   - Imagine you are the person doing the hiring. This person usually cares deeply about the job's productivity and outcomes.
   - Write your résumé to appeal directly to them.
   - Ask yourself: What makes someone the perfect candidate? What does the employer really want? What special abilities would this person have? What sets an exceptional candidate apart from a very good one?
   - If unsure, gather information by asking people in the same field or even calling the prospective employer.

2. **Write with Intention**
   - Address the employer’s real needs to get a response.
   - Every step in producing your résumé should convey that you are an exceptional candidate.

3. **Prepare Before You Write**
   - Get clear on what the employer is looking for and what you have to offer.
   - Write answers to questions like: What would make someone the perfect candidate?
   - Prioritize these qualities based on their importance to the employer.

4. **Brainstorm Your Fit**
   - Brainstorm why you are the person who best fulfills the employer's needs.
   - Include everything you’ve done that demonstrates your fit.
   - Use your entire life experience, not just work-related accomplishments.

5. **Highlight Unique Talents**
   - Determine which of your talents best fit the employer's needs.
   - Use this talent to craft an attractive and compelling résumé.

6. **Showcase What You Can Do**
   - Employers care about what you can do with what you know, not just what you know.
   - Avoid assuming that qualifications or years of experience alone will get you the job.
   - Emphasize your specific value to prospective employers.

7. **Be Creative**
   - Especially important if you are making a career change or are new to the job market.
   - Use brainstorming pages as raw material for crafting your résumé.

8. **Use Templates if Needed**
   - If you are not a designer, consider using résumé templates from Microsoft Word or other sources.
   - A quick search can lead you to various options suited for your job interests.

9. **Choose the Right Format**
   - Decide which résumé format fits your needs best.
   - Do not automatically assume that a traditional format is the best for you.
   - More about résumé formats will be discussed later in the résumé format section.
