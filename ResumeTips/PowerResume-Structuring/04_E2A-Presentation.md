#### Importance of Presentation

- **Evidence:** Includes mandatory information such as work history with descriptions, dates, education, affiliations, and software mastered. This should be placed in the second half of your résumé.

#### Dividing Your Résumé

1. **Hot Section (Selling Advertisement):**
   - This is the first half of your résumé.
   - Focuses on advertising yourself and making a strong impression.
   - Every word should ignite the employer's interest.

2. **Not-so-hot Section (Evidence):**
   - Second half of your résumé.
   - Contains detailed information about your work history, education, and affiliations.
   - Present these facts in a concise and organized manner.
