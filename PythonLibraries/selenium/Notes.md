## Selenium with Python Tutorial - Getting Started

This  provides an introduction to Selenium with Python and demonstrates basic setup steps.

**Key Points:**

* Selenium is a framework for automating web browser interactions.
* It allows tasks like clicking buttons, filling forms, and scraping data.
* This tutorial focuses on using Chrome as the browser.

**Installation:**

1. **Verify Python Installation:** Ensure you have Python installed.
2. **Install pip:** pip is a package installer for Python. Check if it's working by typing `pip` or `pip3` in your terminal/command prompt. If you encounter errors, refer to the video's troubleshooting tips or a separate video on fixing pip.
3. **Install Selenium:** Use `pip install selenium` in your terminal/command prompt.
4. **Download ChromeDriver:**
   - Go to the ChromeDriver download page (link provided in the video description).
   - Choose the version compatible with your Chrome browser version.
   - Extract the downloaded zip file.

**Setting Up ChromeDriver Path:**

1. **Locate ChromeDriver File:**  Identify the location where you extracted the ChromeDriver executable.
2. **Copy Path:** Copy the complete path to the ChromeDriver file.

**Python Script:**

```python
from selenium import webdriver

# Replace 'PATH_TO_CHROME_DRIVER' with the actual path to your ChromeDriver
path = 'PATH_TO_CHROME_DRIVER'

# Set up Chrome webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(path)

# Open a webpage
url = "https://techwithtim.net/"
driver.get(url)

# Print the webpage title
print(driver.title)

# Close the browser (entire window)
driver.quit()
```

Remember to replace `'PATH_TO_CHROME_DRIVER'` with the actual path to your ChromeDriver executable file. 

**Example Actions:**

- Print the webpage title: `driver.title`

**Next Steps:**

The next will showcase interacting with webpages using Selenium, including entering text, submitting forms, and navigating pages.

# Selenium Webdriver Tutorial 2: Accessing Elements on a Page

In this tutorial, we learn how to access elements on a webpage using Selenium Webdriver. We'll focus on finding elements by their IDs, names, and class names.

## Overview of HTML Code and Accessing Elements

When working with Selenium, it's crucial to understand HTML structure and how to access elements within it. Common ways to access elements include using IDs, names, and class names.

- **ID**: Unique identifier for an element.
- **Name**: Often unique, used when ID is unavailable.
- **Class Name**: Not necessarily unique, can return multiple elements.

## Example: Searching for an Element

We'll use an example of a search bar on a webpage and demonstrate how to access and interact with it using Selenium.

1. Inspect the element in the browser to identify its attributes (e.g., ID, name, class).
2. Use Selenium to find the element and perform actions.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

# Set up Chrome WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open webpage
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Find search bar by name
search_bar = driver.find_element_by_name("search")

# Enter text into search bar
search_bar.send_keys("test")

# Press Enter key
search_bar.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

# Wait for results to load
# Perform actions on search results
# Close WebDriver
driver.quit()
```

## Accessing HTML Source Code

You can access the entire HTML source code of a webpage using Selenium. This can be useful for scraping data or understanding page structure.

```python
# Access HTML source code
html_source = driver.page_source
print(html_source)
```

## Scraping Search Results

We'll demonstrate how to scrape search results from a webpage using Selenium.

```python
# Find main element containing search results
main_element = driver.find_element_by_id("main")

# Find all article elements within main
articles = main_element.find_elements_by_tag_name("article")

# Loop through articles and print titles
for article in articles:
    title_element = article.find_element_by_class_name("entry-title")
    print(title_element.text)
```
