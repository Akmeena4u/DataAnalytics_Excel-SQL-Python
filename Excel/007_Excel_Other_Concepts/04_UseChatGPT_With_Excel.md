# Using ChatGPT with Excel for Easier and More Efficient Tasks

## Introduction
- **ChatGPT**: An advanced natural language processing model using deep learning to generate human-like text responses.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate how to use ChatGPT to assist with Excel tasks.

## Methods to Use ChatGPT with Excel
1. **Manual Query Method**
    - Convert Excel problems into questions.
    - Ask ChatGPT for the formula or solution.
    - Use the response in Excel.
2. **API Integration Method**
    - Integrate ChatGPT with Excel through API.
    - Build interactive chat bots to answer queries and assist with tasks.

## Manual Query Method

### Example 1: Calculating Sum
- **Scenario**: Calculate the total marks of a student in three subjects.
- **Steps**:
    1. Write the query: `Provide me a formula to add cells C3 to C5 in my Excel sheet`.
    2. ChatGPT response: `=SUM(C3:C5)`.
    3. Enter the formula in Excel.

### Example 2: Summing Marks of Multiple Students
- **Scenario**: Total the marks of five students in three subjects.
- **Steps**:
    1. Write the query: `Provide me an Excel formula to add marks from C3 to E3 in my Excel sheet`.
    2. ChatGPT response: `=SUM(C3:E3)`.
    3. Enter and expand the formula in Excel.

### Example 3: Calculating Average
- **Scenario**: Calculate the average marks of students in three subjects.
- **Steps**:
    1. Write the query: `I want to calculate average marks from cell C3 to E3 in my Excel sheet`.
    2. ChatGPT response: `=AVERAGE(C3:E3)`.
    3. Enter and expand the formula in Excel.

### Example 4: Finding Specific Data Using Lookup Functions
- **Scenario**: Find total marks of a specific student.
- **Steps**:
    1. Write the query: `Write an Excel formula to find Student 3 in a table and return the total marks, student in B column and their total marks in F column`.
    2. ChatGPT response: `=VLOOKUP("Student 3", B:F, 6, FALSE)`.
    3. Enter the formula in Excel.
    4. Alternative method provided by ChatGPT: `INDEX(F:F, MATCH("Student 3", B:B, 0))`.

## Writing Macros with ChatGPT
- **Introduction to Macros**: Programs that automate repetitive tasks by recording and replaying a series of steps.
- **Steps to Enable Macros**:
    1. Go to Ribbon -> Right-click -> Customize the Ribbon.
    2. Check the Developer option.
- **Creating a Macro to Send Emails**:
    1. Set up your Outlook account.
    2. Write the query: `Write a macro to send email. Use the following text: "Congratulations. You have passed the exam with X marks." Take value of X from column B and send to the email address listed in column A`.
    3. Copy the provided macro and paste it in VBA editor.
    4. Change the sheet name if necessary.
    5. Run the macro to send emails.

### Example: Sending Email with Macro
- **Steps**:
    1. Copy the macro code provided by ChatGPT.
    2. Replace sheet name as required.
    3. Run the macro from the Developer tab.
    4. Verify emails sent via Outlook.

## Conclusion
- ChatGPT can assist in solving a range of Excel problems from basic to advanced levels.
- Always double-check responses from ChatGPT as it is an AI and may occasionally provide incorrect results.
- Future videos will cover API integration for more advanced interactions.
