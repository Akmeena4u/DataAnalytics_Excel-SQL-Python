# Excel Map Chart

## Introduction
- The **Map Chart** is a new addition in Excel, available only in Excel 2019 and later versions.
- It is not available in Excel 2016 or earlier versions.
- Map charts are useful for displaying geographical data, filling a long-standing gap in Excel's chart options.

## Key Features
- **Geographical Data Visualization**: Allows you to highlight regions like countries, states, cities, and postal codes with corresponding values.
- **Internet Connectivity Required**: To create a map chart, an active internet connection is necessary for the initial data retrieval.

## Example Usage
- **Data Setup**: 
  - In the provided Excel file, the first sheet contains country names and corresponding COVID-19 case numbers.
  - Select the data, click on the Maps option, and choose the filled map.

- **Rendering**:
  - The map chart connects to the internet to fetch geographical data for plotting.
  - After creation, the chart can be viewed offline.

- **Visualization**:
  - The chart color intensity corresponds to the data values (e.g., darker shades for higher values).

## Formatting Map Charts

### Specific Formatting Options for Map Charts
- **Map Projection**:
  - Set to automatic by default.
  - Choose from three different map projections if needed.

- **Map Area**:
  - Show only regions with data or the entire world map.
