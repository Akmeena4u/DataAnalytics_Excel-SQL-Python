# Lecture Notes: Area Charts

## Introduction to Area Charts
- **Similarity to Line Charts:** 
  - Area charts are essentially line charts with the area below the line filled with color.
- **Example:**
  - Shirt sales in four quarters represented as a line chart and an area chart.
  - Area chart colors the area below the line for visual emphasis.

## Creating Area Charts
1. **Single Data Series:**
   - Area chart is created similarly to a line chart but with the area under the line colored.
2. **Multiple Data Series:**
   - Similar to line charts with multiple lines.
   - Each area below the lines is colored, which can make interpretation difficult.

## Customizing Area Charts
1. **Adding Data Series:**
   - Example: Adding "pants" and "others" data series.
   - **Legend Box:** Essential for identifying which color represents which series.
2. **Adjusting Transparency:**
   - To view overlapping data series, increase the transparency of the top series.
   - Example: Increase transparency of "pants" and "others" series to reveal "shirts" series.

## Types of Area Charts
1. **Stacked Area Chart:**
   - Places data series values on top of each other.
   - Example: Q1 shirt sales at 470, pants sales stacked to 1200, others sales stacked to 1600.
   - Clearly shows contribution of each series to the total.
2. **100% Stacked Area Chart:**
   - Normalizes total to 100%.
   - Shows each product's contribution as a percentage of the total.

## 3D Area Charts
1. **3D Area Chart:**
   - Adds a 3D effect to the area chart.
   - Each series appears as a 3D wall.
   - **Issue:** Data can be obscured behind other series, making it hard to interpret.
   - **Recommendation:** Not suitable for business use despite visual appeal.

2. **3D Stacked Area Chart and 3D 100% Stacked Area Chart:**
   - Same concepts as 2D stacked area charts but with a 3D effect.
   - Similar issues with data obscurity and interpretation.

## Conclusion
- **Transparency Adjustment:** Useful for viewing overlapping data in regular area charts.
- **Stacked Area Charts:** Preferable for showing contributions of multiple series.
- **3D Area Charts:** Generally not recommended for business due to data visibility issues.
