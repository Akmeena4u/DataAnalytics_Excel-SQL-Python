# Lecture Notes: Pie Charts and Doughnut Charts

## Introduction to Pie Charts
- **Purpose:** Show relative proportions or contributions to a whole.
- **Data Series:** Typically uses only one data series.
- **Effective Use:** Ideal for a small number of data points (slices).

## Creating Pie Charts
1. **Single Data Series:**
   - Insert > Recommended Charts or select Pie Chart icon.
   - Data labels help in identifying slice values.
   - Data labels can be customized for value, percentage, or both.

2. **Exploding Slices:**
   - Highlight specific slices by exploding them from the chart.
   - Helps draw attention to particular contributions.

## Types of Pie Charts
1. **Simple Pie Chart:**
   - Basic representation of data proportions.
2. **3D Pie Chart:**
   - Adds a 3D effect but doesn't enhance data interpretation significantly.
3. **Pie of Pie and Bar of Pie:**
   - Secondary charts provide more detail for selected pie slices.
   - Useful for highlighting subcategories within a larger category.

## Customizing Pie Charts
1. **Exploding Slices:**
   - Double-click and drag slices to explode them for emphasis.
2. **Data Labels:**
   - Choose the position and content of data labels (value, percentage, category name).
3. **Formatting Options:**
   - Adjust transparency, colors, and other visual elements.
   - Stack data labels neatly to avoid clutter and improve readability.

## Introduction to Doughnut Charts
- **Features:** Similar to pie charts but with a hole in the center.
- **Multiple Data Series:** Can display more than one series of data.

## Creating Doughnut Charts
1. **Single Data Series:**
   - Insert > Recommended Charts or select Doughnut Chart icon.
   - Customize data labels, ring width, and hole size for clarity.
2. **Multiple Data Series:**
   - Displays contributions of different series within each ring.
   - Can be cluttered with multiple categories and should be used sparingly.

## Conclusion
- **Pie Charts:** Effective for showing proportions or contributions.
- **Doughnut Charts:** Suitable for comparing multiple data series within a whole.
- **Usage:** Use pie and doughnut charts judiciously, ensuring clarity and readability.
