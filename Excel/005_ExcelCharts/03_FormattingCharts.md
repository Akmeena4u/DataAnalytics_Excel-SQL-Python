6. **Vertical Axis:**
   - Adjust bounds (e.g., minimum and maximum values).
   - Change number format (e.g., add decimal places, display as currency).

## Practical Examples
1. **Adjusting Vertical Axis Bounds:**
   - Change minimum and maximum values to zoom in on specific data ranges.
   
2. **Number Formatting:**
   - Show decimal values if necessary.
   - Display numbers as currency (e.g., dollars).

## Summary
- **Formatting Techniques:** Learned how to format various chart elements.
- **Customization:** Applied backgrounds, borders, and changed fonts and colors.
- **Practical Adjustments:** Adjusted vertical axis bounds and formatted numbers for clarity.

In the next , we will continue to explore more advanced formatting techniques and apply these concepts to different types of charts.
