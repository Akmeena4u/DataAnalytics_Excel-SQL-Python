# Creating and Interpreting Waterfall Charts in Excel

## Introduction
- Waterfall charts visualize sequential positive or negative changes from a base value.
- Commonly used in financial analysis to show net value through gains or losses over time.
- Two ways to create a waterfall chart: Excel 2016's built-in feature and manual creation for earlier versions.

## Excel 2016 Method
1. Insert > Waterfall Chart.
2. Specify basic values: base, total, gains, and losses.
3. Customize colors and formatting for clarity.

## Manual Creation (Excel 2013 or Earlier)
1. Use bar or column charts with invisible series.
2. Create data for stacked columns: invisible series (zero) and display series (actual values).
3. Plot stacked columns, adjusting for dips and rises by manipulating series values.
4. Customize colors and formatting for clarity.

## Conclusion
- Waterfall charts are effective for visualizing financial data.
- Excel 2016 offers a built-in feature, while earlier versions require manual creation using stacked columns.
