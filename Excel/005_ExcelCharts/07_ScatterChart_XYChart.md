# Lecture Notes: Scatter Plots and Bubble Charts

## Scatter Plots (XY Charts)
- **Purpose:** Show relationship between two variables.
- **Axis Representation:** Both axes display numerical values.
- **Usage:** Identify trends or correlations in data pairs.

### Creating Scatter Plots
1. **Data Selection:**
   - Choose two variables for X and Y axes.
   - Select data points to plot on the scatter plot.

2. **Chart Types:**
   - Simple Scatter Plot: Displays data points as dots.
   - Scatter Plot with Smooth Lines: Connects points with smooth curves.
   - Scatter Plot with Lines: Connects points with straight lines.
   - Trend Line: Visualizes the trend or relationship between variables.

3. **Trend Lines:**
   - Linear, Logarithmic, Polynomial trend lines available.
   - Trend lines help forecast values based on data trends.
   - Equation of the trend line provides a mathematical model.

## Bubble Charts
- **Purpose:** Extend scatter plots to include a third variable.
- **Representation:** X-axis, Y-axis, and bubble size (radius) for the third variable.
- **Usage:** Analyze the impact of two variables on a third variable.

### Creating Bubble Charts
1. **Data Selection:**
   - Choose three data series: X-axis, Y-axis, and bubble size.
   - Customize bubble size to represent the third variable.

2. **Chart Types:**
   - 2D Bubble Chart: Displays data points as circles with varying sizes.
   - 3D Bubble Chart: Adds depth to the bubbles, representing data in a 3D space.

### Interpretation and Analysis
- **Trend Identification:** Use scatter plots and bubble charts to identify trends and correlations.
- **Trend Lines:** Add trend lines to visualize data trends and forecast future values.
- **Equation of Trend Line:** Calculate the equation of the trend line for predictive modeling.

## Conclusion
- **Scatter Plots:** Effective for analyzing relationships between two variables.
- **Bubble Charts:** Extend analysis to include a third variable's impact on the relationship.
- **Trend Analysis:** Use trend lines to forecast values based on data patterns.
